# Linguistic Unity

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Design is still under construction.<br/>
:::

## Summary
We say that a [community](@) has the property of being a **linguistic unity** if there is a single [terminology](@) (language) that every member of the [community](@) uses.

The mere existence of a [glossary](@) that is developed (and perhaps also maintained) in a [community](@) is not a sure sign a [linguistic unity](@). Different members in a [community](@) that has developed a [glossary](@) may keep using their own preferred [terms](@). If this is done in documentation, readers may get confused because

:::info Editor's note
examples of the aforementioned statement are needed/should be added, e.g. as a footnote
:::

Being a [linguistic unity](@) does not mean, however, that people have a [common understanding](@): members of the [community](@) may use the same words, but still assign them with different meaning ([semantics](@)).

## Purpose
Having a [terminology](@) that every member of a [community](@) uses in the same way/meaning is one of the prerequisites for efficiently and effectively working together.

## Criteria
A [community](@) has the property of being (or: is) a **linguistic unity** if there is (at least) one [terminology](@), the [terms](@) of which are used by every member of that [community](@).
