:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Design is still under construction.

Every text that is written is meant to be read by people (that belong to its intended audience), and stimulate or enable them to do particular things. Whitepapers, opinion papers, specifications, standardization texts, advertisements, memo's, mails, etc. could just as well not have been written if they did not have that property.

For us, a high-quality text is a text that not only has a specific audience and serves one or more specific purposes, but also a text that doesn't require its readers to 'hallucinate', i.e. make assumptions so as to understand the intention of its author. Such texts are typically well-suited for specifications, standards, educational materials etc. However, there are also situations in which this kind of quality is not necessary (e.g., in management summaries, or casual notes), or even counter-productive (e.g., in advertisements).

In order to write a high-quality text, its [author(s)](@) not only need the appropriate knowledge about the topic of the text; they must have (or create) a conscious understanding of that knowledge that enables them to describe what they mean to say using [words and phrases](term@) that have a sufficiently well-defined meaning. This is not trivial: often, people that have knowledge about some topic can demonstrate that they do (using the knowledge), while not being capable of expressing the knowledge itself in a fashion that enables [readers](@) to learn it.[^1] Also, it takes discipline to (re)write texts so that in the end, all important [terms](@) are used in the way they are defined, and are used consistently and coherently.

[^1]: For example, people that are native speakers of a language, can usually demonstrate their knowledge of the specifications of that language (its grammar), by showing that they can (1) determine whether or not a sentence in that language is grammatically correct, (2) correct the sentences that were incorrect and (3) come up with (say) 5 alternatives for correcting an incorrect sentence, and picking out 'the most beautiful', or 'the best' one. However, when asked whether they could write down the specifications such that the result is consistent, coherent, complete, cogent, congruent - and other c-words that refer to characteristics that specifications are typically expected to have, they will say 'no'. Even worse: if they are presented a booklet that is about the grammar of their mother's tongue, and are asked to determine whether or not it specifies that grammar in a consistent, coherent, complete, etc. way, they will also decline.

This page intends to provide guidance for an [author](@) regarding how to deal with the [terminology](@) as (s)he writes a high-quality text.[^2] We assume the [author](@) has identified the audience that the text addresses, and what the audience will be doing with (the messages contained in) the text. We also assume that the [author](@) has some idea about which [terms](@) have a high likelihood of being misunderstood by (parts of) the audience, e.g. because they are contentious or can be interpreted in different ways.

[^2]: Writing styles, methods for creating a text outline and similar topics that may be relevant for writing good texts are outside the scope.

## Prerequisites

:::info Editor's note
This section introduces the [scope](@) in which the text will be created. It postulates the existence of
- a glossary that contains all [terms](@) the [definition](@) (and further explanations) of which are expected to be beneficial to (some of) the [readers](@).
- a mechanism for creating and updating (parts of) such a glossary in case it doesn't exist, or needs maintenance.
:::

## Using TermRefs

:::info Editor's note
This section introduces [TermRefs](@), and encourages authors to use one for every occurrence of a [term](@) whose likelihood of being misunderstood by (parts of) the audience needs to be decreased. This section has some subsections
- in case the [term](@) to be used is defined in a glossary of another [scope](@) (regardless of whether or not it is defined in one's own glossary)
- in case the [term](@) to be used is not yet defined; then, a contribution to add the term must be initiated
:::

## Creating and/or Modifying Terms

:::info Editor's note
This section specifies how a contribution to the existing [terminology](@) of a [scope](@) can be made in the case where the [term](@):
- already exists, but has a different meaning from what the author needs;
- does not yet exist, and is relatively simple to add;
- does not yet exist, but it is not simple to add because it relies on several other terms that are not defined (in the meaning needed)
:::

## Proofreading

:::info Editor's note
This section specifies how to finish up the paper, by making sure that
- every [term](@) (better: [TermRef](@)) is associated with a good [definition](@);
- every [term](@) is used in the meaning in which it is defined;
:::

## Publication

:::info Editor's note
This section specifies what needs to be done to make it ready for publication, which consists of
- determining whether or not, and if so, where and how, a glossary needs to be made part of the paper, where that glossary contains an appropriate rendering of all [terms](@) for which a [TermRef](@) exists in the paper;
- making sure all contributions to [terms](@) that the author has made, have been properly [curated](@), and can be published with the text.
