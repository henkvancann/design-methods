In order for a [community](@) (e.g. a workgroup, taskforce, project/product team, department, etc.) to realize its [objectives](@), it is beneficial that its members have a common set of the ideas, [concepts](@) and other [knowledge artifacts](@) that are relevant for realizing these [objectives](@). The ability to realize such a common understanding, and to demonstrate that this is actually the case, is a critical capability for success.

:::info Editor's note
([Agredo-Delgado, et. al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-021-09326-z))[^1] have tested a process for constructing a shared understanding in computer-supported collaborative work, where the construction part consists of 4 steps:
1. each group member acquires an individual understanding of the subject;
2. each group member exposes his/her ideas and the others actively listen to them;
3. the group refines, builds or modifies the original ideas;
4. the differences of interpretation between the group members are dealt with in a constructive fashion, through arguments and clarifications.
