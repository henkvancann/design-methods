This page describes techniques for establishing a mutual understanding between yourself and one other person, and possibly a common understanding.[^1] This would typically be in a setting in which you can speak to each other, as e.g., in a physical meeting or a voice/video call.

[^1]: A mutual understanding is where you understand the position of the other, and the other understands your position, and disagreements about what is the right, or the best position, may exist. A common understanding is achieved when the both of you are in agreement.

You should not expect that the other person is familiar with the [terminology model](@) and how it is used. Also, you should not attempt to teach  the other person this model (education is a different topic).

The overall structure of these techniques is similar, and consists of

1. first understanding what the other person is trying to express, and
2. then expressing your own understanding of the topic.
